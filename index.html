            Our team is an extracurricular group of students. We all go to the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science. TAMS is a unique residential program for high school-aged Texas students who are high achievers and interested in mathematics and science. While living in McConnell Hall, students in this two-year program complete a rigorous academic curriculum of college coursework at the University of North Texas (UNT). Instruction is by regular university faculty. There are no high school courses taught, but students enjoy many of the activities of high school and the company of age mates who are intellectual peers.

            Our robotics team greatly prioritizes integration with the district and regional community because, as part of a school of students that have shown excellence and interest in the STEM field, it has roots much further than engineering and science itself. For many of our teammates, the club is a chance to connect and help students explore STEM and truly have a chance to learn from it. For many of us, opportunities at our previous institutions for STEM were limited, if at all present. Now, we have the opportunity and obligation to educate, inspire and help the rising generation of students into engineering.
            <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there are a few local schools that cannot afford extra science experiments in the curriculum. However, the Junior Engineering Technical Society or JETS club (robotics is a subset of this) at TAMS, has a program where we create and send STEM boxes to local elementary schools. These boxes contain small, informative experiments that children conduct. Each box caters to a different scientific law or theory or phenomenon and they all come with well-written explanations with pictures, so students can understand the science behind the principle being demonstrated. The boxes are also set on schedule with each school's curriculum. By coordinating with teachers, we maximize the students' knowledge about a subject because they learn about it in class and they get to see firsthand experiments about the subject too.
            <br /> <br />We have been representing the TAMS program at many different events in the DFW region. We were at the Earth Day Event in April 2016, ...
